Moving Zeroes
Write a function that takes an array of integers 
and moves each non-zero integer to the left side                        <---- "to the left to the left" <----
of the array, then returns the altered array.
The order of the non-zero integers does not matter in the mutated array.

Examples
Sample input: [0, 3, 1, 0, -2]
Expected output array state: [3, 1, -2, 0, 0]
Sample input: [4, 2, 1, 5]
Expected output array state: [4, 2, 1, 5]
Optional: Can you do this in a single pass through the input array with O(1) space?

Input: a List of integers
Returns: a List of integers
Uncomment code and begin!!
